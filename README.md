## Wireframes

The wireframes have been created in order to allow the members of the team to have an overview of what the website will look like or a simple vision to guide us to completion of the website.

However, the website frameworks have not really been followed as we decided to implement a more simplicity for the pages so that users will find it more easily to familiarise with the webpage.
